                <p>
                    Worked with breadboard to create various forms of circuits and applied ohms law as well as Kirchhoff`s current and voltage laws
                    Used LTSpice to simulate circuits and compared used it as a form of comparison to outcomes from circuits we physically made
                    Used MATLAB to calculate theoretical values of Kirchhoff`s current and voltage laws
                    Assembled and using mesh analysis to determine current flowing through a loop
                    Worked with oscilloscopes, multimeters, and power supplies in order to measure power delivered to a load by using RMS voltage and current
                    Built circuits in order to analyze active filters where we saw a high voltage at low frequencies and low voltages at higher frequencies
                    Utilizing circuits, we were able to see the affects of frequency on phasor values as well as calculate gain
                    Applied superposition and Thevenin theorem in AC circuits using input op-amp, signal generator, oscilloscope, resistors and capacitors.
